General Function:
The console is your control center for the honeypot environment, allowing you to create, deploy, monitor, and interact with your ESXi honeypot instances within an isolated and controlled environment.

Flag Descriptions:

-c, --create: Create Honeypot Instance
This flag initiates the process of setting up a new honeypot container. You'll be prompted to provide details like:
Docker Image: The name of the Docker image containing the honeypot setup (e.g., esxi-honeypot).
IP Address: The desired IP address for the honeypot within the dedicated Docker network.
Hostname: The hostname to be assigned to the honeypot.
The console will then create a dedicated Docker network, if not already existing, and deploy the honeypot container with the specified configurations.

-s, --start: Start Honeypot
This flag starts a pre-existing honeypot container. You'll be asked to specify:
Honeypot Name: The name assigned to the honeypot container during creation.

-st, --stop: Stop Honeypot
Stops a currently running honeypot container. It will request:
Honeypot Name: The name assigned to the honeypot container during creation.

-r, --restart: Restart Honeypot
Restarts a honeypot container, effectively stopping and then starting it again. Like the start and stop commands, it prompts for:
Honeypot Name: The name of the container.

-l, --logs: View Honeypot Logs
Retrieves and displays the logs generated by a specific honeypot container. It prompts for:
Honeypot Name: The container's name to retrieve logs from.

-S, --status: View Honeypot Status
This command provides a summarized view of all active honeypot containers, including their:
Honeypot Name
Status: Current state of the container (running, stopped, etc.)
IP Address: The IP address assigned within the Docker network.

-h, --help: Display Help Message
Provides a concise overview of all available console commands and their corresponding flags.
